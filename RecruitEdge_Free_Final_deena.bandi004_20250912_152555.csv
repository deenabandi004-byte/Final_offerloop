I hope this message finds you well. My name is Nicholas Wittig, and I am a Business Administration major at the University of Southern California, graduating in 2027. I am deeply interested in pursuing a career in finance and am eager to learn from professionals in the field.

I came across your profile and was impressed by your journey as a software engineer at Google. I believe your insights could provide valuable guidance as I explore potential pathways in finance within tech companies. 

Would you be open to a brief 15-20 minute chat in the next couple of weeks? I would greatly appreciate any advice you could share about your experiences and the finance landscape at Google.

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to the possibility of connecting.

Best regards,
Nicholas Wittig
