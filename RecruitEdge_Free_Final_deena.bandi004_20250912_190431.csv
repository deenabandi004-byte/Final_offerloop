I hope this message finds you well. My name is Nicholas Wittig, and I am a Business Administration major at the University of Southern California, graduating in 2027. I am reaching out to connect with you as I am deeply interested in pursuing a career in finance, and I admire the impactful work being done at Boston Consulting Group.

As an aspiring finance professional, I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to learn from your experiences at BCG and gain insights into the finance sector. If you have 15-20 minutes to spare in the next couple of weeks, I would love to chat and hear about your journey from Wayne State University to your current role.

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to the possibility of connecting!

Best regards,
Nicholas Wittig
