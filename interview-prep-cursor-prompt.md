# Interview Prep Feature - Cursor Prompt

## Pre-requisites (Do Outside Cursor First)

### 1. Dependencies Already Installed ✅
You already have `aiohttp` and `beautifulsoup4` installed.

### 2. No Reddit API Key Needed! 
We're using Reddit's public JSON endpoints (no authentication required).

### 3. Create File Structure:
Run this command in your terminal:
```bash
mkdir -p backend/app/services/interview_prep
touch backend/app/services/interview_prep/__init__.py
touch backend/app/services/interview_prep/job_posting_parser.py
touch backend/app/services/interview_prep/reddit_scraper.py
touch backend/app/services/interview_prep/content_processor.py
touch backend/app/services/interview_prep/pdf_generator.py
```

This creates:
```
backend/app/services/interview_prep/
  ├── __init__.py
  ├── job_posting_parser.py    # NEW: Extracts info from job postings
  ├── reddit_scraper.py
  ├── content_processor.py
  └── pdf_generator.py
```

## Cursor Prompt

Paste everything below this line into Cursor:

---

**Build an Interview Prep feature for Offerloop.ai that takes a job posting URL, extracts role details, scrapes Reddit for targeted interview insights, and generates a comprehensive study PDF tailored to that specific role.**

## Context
- This is for Offerloop.ai, a Flask + React networking/career platform
- I already have OpenAI integrated (check existing email generation code for patterns)
- I already have PDF generation logic (check existing coffee chat prep feature in `services/` for reference)
- Using Flask backend on Render, React frontend with TypeScript
- Authentication uses Firebase (check existing protected routes for patterns)
- Credit system already exists (check how coffee chat deducts credits)

## Backend Requirements

### 0. Job Posting Parser (`backend/app/services/interview_prep/job_posting_parser.py`)

```python
# This module extracts structured data from job posting URLs
# Use BeautifulSoup to scrape the job posting page, then OpenAI to extract structured info

import aiohttp
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

async def fetch_job_posting(url: str) -> str:
    """Fetch the raw HTML/text content from a job posting URL"""
    headers = {
        "User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36"
    }
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession(headers=headers) as session:
        async with session.get(url) as resp:
            if resp.status == 200:
                html = await resp.text()
                soup = BeautifulSoup(html, 'html.parser')
                # Remove script and style elements
                for element in soup(['script', 'style', 'nav', 'footer', 'header']):
                    element.decompose()
                return soup.get_text(separator='\n', strip=True)
            raise Exception(f"Failed to fetch job posting: {resp.status}")

# - Filter posts from last 12 months only (use 't=year' param)
# - Grab top 50 most upvoted posts, fetch comments for top 20
# - For each post, get top 10 comments (most insights are in comments!)
# - Add 600ms delay between requests to respect rate limits
# - Timeout after 45 seconds total scraping time
# - Deduplicate posts by ID
# - Return structured data with: post_title, post_body, top_comments[], upvotes, date, subreddit, url

# Example prompt snippet:
"""
Role category: {role_category}

Based on this role category, generate interview prep content following these rules:
- If Consulting: Focus on case interviews, frameworks, market sizing. NO LeetCode or coding.
- If Software Engineering: Focus on coding problems, system design. NO case interviews.
- If Finance: Focus on technicals (DCF, valuation), accounting. NO LeetCode or case interviews.
- If PM: Focus on product sense, estimation. Limited coding.

# CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR OPENAI PROMPT:
# 1. Extract ACTUAL questions mentioned in Reddit posts, not generic ones
# 2. Include SPECIFIC details from candidate experiences (what round, what happened)
# 3. Tailor technical questions to the required_skills from job posting
# 4. Make compensation LEVEL-APPROPRIATE (intern vs full-time vs senior)
# 5. Include real quotes from Reddit where impactful
# 6. Note data gaps honestly rather than making things up
# 7. Make company-specific questions actually specific (not "Why do you want to work here?")
```

### 3. PDF Generator (`backend/app/services/interview_prep/pdf_generator.py`)

```python
# Follow the SAME pattern as existing coffee chat PDF generation
# Use the same PDF library and styling approach
# TARGET: 7-8 page comprehensive prep guide TAILORED TO THE SPECIFIC ROLE

# CRITICAL: The PDF must feel personalized, not generic. Every section should reference
# the specific company, role, level, and skills from the job posting.

# PDF Structure:

# PAGE 1 - Professional Cover Page
# ================================
# 1. Company logo - LARGE, centered (use Clearbit: https://logo.clearbit.com/{domain})
#    - Make it prominent, this immediately shows personalization
# 2. Job title in large, bold text (e.g., "Software Engineering Intern")
# 3. Company name below (e.g., "at Apple")
# 4. Styled job details box with icons:
#    ┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
#    │ 📍 Location: Cupertino, CA (On-site)    │
#    │ 👥 Team: Apple Intelligence             │
#    │ 📊 Level: Intern                        │
#    │ 📅 Type: Summer 2025 Internship         │
#    └─────────────────────────────────────────┘
# 5. Quick stats bar: "5 stages | 4-6 weeks | 25 sources"
# 6. "Required Skills" section - show the skills from the job posting as tags/chips:
#    [Swift] [iOS] [Python] [Data Structures] [Git]

#    - Below each stage, show:
#      * Duration (e.g., "45 min")
#      * Who you'll meet (e.g., "Senior Engineer")
#      * Format (e.g., "Video Call")
# 9. Level-specific callout box:
#    "💡 For intern roles: Focus on fundamentals and learning ability over deep experience"
# 10. Timeline expectations with specific dates:
#     "Typical timeline: Apply → Offer in 4-6 weeks"

# PAGE 3-4 - Questions (2 pages, comprehensive)
# =============================================
# 11. "Questions You'll Face at {company_name}"
#

# - Example for Apple: "Tell me about a time you obsessed over details"
# - Example for Amazon: "Describe a time you disagreed with your manager"
# - Tie to company values (Apple = innovation/design, Amazon = leadership principles)
#
# TECHNICAL - MUST BE TAILORED TO required_skills:
# - If job mentions "Swift": Include Swift-specific questions
# - If job mentions "Python": Include Python questions
# - If job mentions "System Design": Include system design questions
# - Format: Show the question AND a brief hint for answering
#   Example:

# - "Why {company_name}?" - with tips on what they want to hear
# - Product-specific questions:
#   * Apple: "How would you improve Siri?" / "What's your favorite Apple product?"
#   * Google: "How would you improve Google Maps?"
#   * Amazon: "How would you reduce delivery times?"
# - Culture/values questions specific to the company
#
# ACTUAL QUESTIONS FROM REDDIT:
# - Include 3-5 REAL questions that candidates reported being asked

#     - If System Design: "System Design prep: 'Designing Data-Intensive Applications'"

# PAGE 6 - Interview Day & What to Avoid
# ======================================
# 15. "Interview Day Checklist"

#     Example: "Apple interviewers noted candidates who couldn't articulate WHY Apple"

# PAGE 7 - Real Experiences
# =========================
# 17. "What Candidates Said About {company_name} Interviews"
#     - 3-5 detailed experiences from Reddit
#     - MUST include specifics, not vague summaries:
#       * What questions they were asked (actual questions if mentioned)
#       * What surprised them
#       * What they wish they knew
#       * Whether they got the offer
#     - Format as cards/boxes with:
#       ┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
#       │ 👤 SWE Intern Candidate (2024)          │
#       │ ⭐ Difficulty: Medium                   │
#       │                                         │
#       │ "The first round was a LeetCode medium  │
#       │ on arrays. Second round focused on my   │
#       │ iOS project and Swift knowledge..."     │
#       │                                         │
#       │ 💡 Tip: "Know your resume deeply"       │
#       │ ✅ Result: Offer received               │
#       └─────────────────────────────────────────┘

# PAGE 8 - Compensation & Next Steps
# ==================================
# 18. "Compensation for {job_title} at {company_name}"
#     - LEVEL-APPROPRIATE data:
#       * For INTERNS: Hourly rate, housing stipend, relocation, perks
#         "Apple SWE Interns: $45-55/hr + $3,000 housing stipend + relocation"
#       * For FULL-TIME: Base, bonus, equity, total comp
#         Show ranges: "L3: $150-180k base + $50k stock"
#     - Benefits highlights specific to company
#     - Negotiation tips appropriate to level

#
# 20. Footer on every page:
#     "Powered by Offerloop.ai | Based on {X} Reddit posts | Generated {date}"
#     + Company logo small in corner

# ==================
# STYLING REQUIREMENTS
# ==================
# - Company logo on EVERY page (header or footer)
# - Use brand colors where possible (Apple = white/gray, Google = blue/red/yellow/green)
# - Visual elements: timelines, progress bars, card boxes, icons
# - Color-coded sections (green for tips, red for warnings, blue for info)
# - Highlight required skills wherever they appear (bold or colored)
# - Professional but friendly tone
# - Page numbers on every page
# - Clear visual hierarchy with consistent spacing
# - No walls of text - use bullets, cards, and visual breaks

# Store PDF in same location as coffee chat PDFs (check existing implementation)
```

### 4. Flask Routes (`backend/app/routes/interview_prep.py` or add to existing routes file)

```python
# POST /api/interview-prep/generate
# Request body: { "job_posting_url": "https://boards.greenhouse.io/..." }
# 
# Flow:
# 1. Receive job posting URL from frontend
# 2. Fetch and parse job posting (job_posting_parser.py)
# 3. Extract job details (company, role, level, skills, etc.)
# 4. Use job details to build targeted Reddit searches (reddit_scraper.py)
# 5. Process Reddit data with OpenAI (content_processor.py)
# 6. Generate PDF (pdf_generator.py)
# 7. Return PDF URL to user
#
# Requirements:
# - Require authentication (use same auth decorator as other protected routes)
# - Check user has sufficient credits (use INTERVIEW_PREP_CREDITS = 25)
# - Deduct credits on success (check how coffee chat does this)
# - Return: { "id": prep_id, "status": "processing", "job_details": {...} }

@app.route('/api/interview-prep/generate', methods=['POST'])
@require_auth  # Use your existing auth decorator
async def generate_interview_prep():
    data = request.json
    job_posting_url = data.get('job_posting_url')
    
    if not job_posting_url:
        return jsonify({"error": "Job posting URL is required"}), 400
    
    # Check credits
    user_credits = get_user_credits(current_user)  # Use existing credit check
    if user_credits < 25:
        return jsonify({"error": "Insufficient credits. Need 25 credits."}), 402
    
    # Create prep record in database
    prep_id = create_interview_prep_record(current_user, job_posting_url)
    
    # Start async job (use existing background task pattern from coffee chat)
    start_interview_prep_job(prep_id, job_posting_url)
    
    return jsonify({
        "id": prep_id,
        "status": "processing",
        "message": "Analyzing job posting and gathering interview insights..."
    })

# GET /api/interview-prep/status/<prep_id>
# - Return current status, job details extracted, and result when complete
# - Same polling pattern as coffee chat
# Response when processing:
# { "id": "...", "status": "processing", "progress": "Scraping Reddit for insights..." }
# Response when complete:
# { "id": "...", "status": "completed", "job_details": {...}, "pdfUrl": "..." }

# GET /api/interview-prep/download/<prep_id>
# - Return { "pdfUrl": signed_url }
# - Same pattern as coffee chat download

# GET /api/interview-prep/history
# - Return list of user's past interview preps
# - Include: id, job_title, company_name, created_at, pdf_url
```

### 5. Error Handling
- Handle invalid/inaccessible job posting URLs (return friendly error: "Could not access job posting. Please check the URL or try pasting the job description directly.")
- Handle cases where job posting site blocks scraping (LinkedIn often does this) - suggest copying job description text instead
- Handle cases where no Reddit posts are found (suggest company may be too small/new)
- Handle Reddit rate limits (429) with exponential backoff retry logic
- Timeout the entire generation after 90 seconds
- Return user-friendly error messages with suggestions
- If fewer than 5 posts found, warn user that prep guide may be limited

## Frontend Requirements

### Update `connect-grow-hire/src/pages/Home.tsx` - Replace the Interview Prep Tab

Find the existing `<TabsContent value="interview-prep">` section (around line 1668) and replace it with a FULLY FUNCTIONAL implementation.

**New state variables to add** (add near other state declarations around line 200):
```typescript
// Interview Prep state
const [interviewPrepLoading, setInterviewPrepLoading] = useState(false);
const [interviewPrepProgress, setInterviewPrepProgress] = useState<string>("");
const [interviewPrepId, setInterviewPrepId] = useState<string | null>(null);
const [interviewPrepResult, setInterviewPrepResult] = useState<any | null>(null);
const [interviewPrepStatus, setInterviewPrepStatus] = useState<'idle' | 'processing' | 'completed' | 'failed'>('idle');
const [jobPostingUrl, setJobPostingUrl] = useState("");
const [parsedJobDetails, setParsedJobDetails] = useState<any | null>(null);
```

**Credit cost constant** (add near COFFEE_CHAT_CREDITS):
```typescript
const INTERVIEW_PREP_CREDITS = 25;
```

**Handler function** (add near handleCoffeeChatSubmit):
```typescript
const handleInterviewPrepSubmit = async () => {
  // 1. Validate job posting URL
  if (!jobPostingUrl.trim()) {
    toast({ title: "Please enter a job posting URL", variant: "destructive" });
    return;
  }
  
  // 2. Check credits
  const currentCredits = await checkCredits();
  if (currentCredits < INTERVIEW_PREP_CREDITS) {
    toast({ title: "Insufficient credits", description: `You need ${INTERVIEW_PREP_CREDITS} credits.`, variant: "destructive" });
    return;
  }
  
  // 3. Start generation
  setInterviewPrepLoading(true);
  setInterviewPrepStatus('processing');
  setInterviewPrepProgress('Analyzing job posting...');
  
  try {
    // 4. Call API to start generation
    const response = await apiService.generateInterviewPrep(jobPostingUrl);
    setInterviewPrepId(response.id);
    
    // 5. Poll for status until complete (same pattern as coffee chat)
    // Update progress messages:
    // - "Analyzing job posting..."
    // - "Extracting role requirements..."
    // - "Searching Reddit for interview experiences..."
    // - "Processing insights with AI..."
    // - "Generating your prep guide..."
    
    // 6. On complete, update UI with results
    // 7. Deduct credits on success
  } catch (error) {
    setInterviewPrepStatus('failed');
    toast({ title: "Generation failed", description: error.message, variant: "destructive" });
  } finally {
    setInterviewPrepLoading(false);
  }
};

const downloadInterviewPrepPDF = async (prepId?: string) => {
  // Same pattern as downloadCoffeeChatPDF
};
```

**UI Requirements for the Interview Prep tab:**
- Remove the ComingSoonOverlay
- Single input field:
  - **Job Posting URL** (required) - e.g., "https://boards.greenhouse.io/company/jobs/123"
  - Placeholder text: "Paste the job posting URL here..."
  - Help text: "Supports LinkedIn, Indeed, Greenhouse, Lever, Workday, and most career pages"
- "Generate Interview Prep" button with gradient styling matching coffee chat
- Loading state with Loader2 spinner and step-by-step progress messages:
  1. "Analyzing job posting..."
  2. "Extracting role requirements..."
  3. "Searching for interview experiences..."
  4. "Processing insights..."
  5. "Generating your prep guide..."
- When job details are parsed, show a preview card:
  - Company name + logo
  - Job title
  - Level (if detected)
  - Team/Division (if detected)
  - Key skills extracted
- When complete, show:
  - Full job details card
  - Interview process overview preview
  - Sample questions preview (first 3-5)
  - "Download Full PDF" button (prominent, gradient)
  - "View in Browser" option
- Error state handling with helpful suggestions
- Available for all users (Free and Pro)

**Match the existing UI patterns:**
- Use same Card, CardHeader, CardContent structure as coffee chat
- Use same color scheme (gray-800, gradients, etc.)
- Use same badge styling
- Use same button gradients (purple/pink for primary actions)
- Use same loading/status indicators (Loader2, CheckCircle, XCircle)

---

## API Service Updates

Add to `connect-grow-hire/src/services/api.ts` (or wherever apiService is defined):

```typescript
// Interview Prep API methods
generateInterviewPrep: async (jobPostingUrl: string) => {
  // POST /api/interview-prep/generate
  // Body: { "job_posting_url": jobPostingUrl }
},

getInterviewPrepStatus: async (prepId: string) => {
  // GET /api/interview-prep/status/{prepId}
  // Returns: { id, status, progress?, job_details?, pdfUrl? }
},

downloadInterviewPrepPDF: async (prepId: string) => {
  // GET /api/interview-prep/download/{prepId}
},

getInterviewPrepHistory: async () => {
  // GET /api/interview-prep/history

## Important Implementation Notes

1. **Follow existing patterns** - Look at how coffee chat prep is implemented and mirror that approach for consistency

2. **Credit check** - Users need 25+ credits to use this feature. Check `effectiveUser.credits` before allowing generation

3. **Available for all users** - Interview prep is available for both Free and Pro tier users. No tier restrictions needed.

4. **Polling pattern** - Use the same polling approach as coffee chat (poll every 3 seconds, max 90 seconds timeout - longer due to job parsing + comprehensive scraping)

5. **PDF storage** - Store PDFs in the same location/bucket as coffee chat PDFs

6. **Error messages** - Be user-friendly with actionable suggestions:
   - "Could not access this job posting. Try pasting the job description directly." (for blocked URLs)
   - "No interview data found for [Company]. They may be too new or small." (for obscure companies)
   - "LinkedIn blocks automated access. Try copying the job URL from Greenhouse or the company's career page." (for LinkedIn)

7. **Caching** - Cache results for the same job posting URL for 7 days to avoid re-scraping. If cached, return immediately.

8. **Comprehensive extraction** - The goal is a 5-6 page PDF tailored to THE SPECIFIC ROLE, not generic company info. Use job details to personalize everything.

9. **Job posting site handling** - Different sites need different handling:
   - Greenhouse, Lever, Workday: Usually work well
   - LinkedIn: Often blocks scraping - suggest alternatives
   - Indeed: May work, may not
   - Company career pages: Usually work

10. **Fallback option** - If URL parsing fails, allow users to paste raw job description text as fallback (add a "Paste job description instead" link)

11. **Quality over speed** - It's okay if generation takes 45-90 seconds. Users want comprehensive, role-specific prep guides.

12. **Progress updates** - Show meaningful progress messages during generation:
    - "Fetching job posting..." (0-10%)
    - "Analyzing role requirements..." (10-20%)
    - "Searching Reddit for interview experiences..." (20-50%)
    - "Finding role-specific insights..." (50-70%)
    - "Generating your personalized prep guide..." (70-100%)
