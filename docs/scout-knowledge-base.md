### Troubleshooting (10 examples)

**USER:** My emails aren't saving to Gmail drafts
**SCOUT:** This usually means Gmail isn't connected. Go to Account Settings, find the Gmail section, and click "Connect Gmail". Sign in with Google and grant permissions. Once connected, try your search again - emails should save to drafts automatically.

**USER:** I'm out of credits, what do I do?
**SCOUT:** You have a few options: 1) Check your credits in the sidebar to see when they reset (monthly), 2) Go to Pricing to upgrade your plan (Pro gives 1,500 credits, Elite gives 3,000), 3) Wait for your monthly reset. Credits don't roll over, so use them before they reset!

**USER:** I'm not finding any contacts
**SCOUT:** Try these tips: 1) Use broader job titles (e.g., "Analyst" instead of "Investment Banking Analyst"), 2) Check spelling of company name, 3) Try different locations or remove location filter, 4) Some smaller companies may have limited data. If still no results, the role might be too specific - try a more general title.

**USER:** My emails seem generic
**SCOUT:** Make sure you've uploaded your resume in Account Settings - Pro+ users get resume-matched personalization. Also complete your profile with career interests and university info. The more information you provide, the better the personalization. Free users get basic emails, so consider upgrading to Pro for resume-matched emails.

**USER:** Coffee Chat Prep is taking too long
**SCOUT:** Coffee Chat Prep usually takes 1-2 minutes to generate. If it's been longer than 5 minutes, try refreshing and generating again. Make sure the LinkedIn URL is accessible and correct. If it keeps timing out, the profile might be private or the URL might be invalid.

**USER:** Interview Prep failed to generate
**SCOUT:** Interview Prep can take 2-3 minutes and sometimes fails if: 1) The job posting URL is invalid or inaccessible, 2) Reddit scraping finds no results, 3) The job description is too short. Try pasting the job description manually instead of using the URL, or try a different job posting.

**USER:** My subscription didn't update
**SCOUT:** If you upgraded but your plan isn't showing: 1) Refresh the page, 2) Go to Pricing and click "Manage Subscription" to check Stripe, 3) Make sure payment went through, 4) Check if credits were added (they should be immediate). If still not working, contact support.

**USER:** I can't access Firm Search
**SCOUT:** Firm Search is a Pro+ feature, so Free users don't have access. Upgrade to Pro ($9.99/month) or Elite ($34.99/month) to unlock Firm Search. Pro also gives you more credits (1,500 vs 300) and other premium features.

**USER:** My resume won't upload
**SCOUT:** Make sure your resume is: 1) A PDF file (not Word or other formats), 2) Under 10MB, 3) Not password-protected, 4) Properly formatted. If it still fails, try a different PDF or contact support. The resume parser works best with clean, well-formatted PDFs.

**USER:** Gmail connection keeps failing
**SCOUT:** Try these steps: 1) Disconnect Gmail in Account Settings, 2) Clear browser cache and cookies, 3) Reconnect Gmail, 4) Make sure you're signing in with the correct Google account, 5) Grant all requested permissions. If it still fails, try a different browser or contact support.

### Account/Billing Questions (5 examples)

**USER:** How do I cancel my subscription?
**SCOUT:** Go to Pricing and click "Manage Subscription". This opens Stripe's customer portal where you can cancel your subscription. Your plan will remain active until the end of your billing period, then revert to Free tier.

**USER:** When do my credits reset?
**SCOUT:** Credits reset monthly on the same day you started your subscription. For example, if you subscribed on the 15th, credits reset on the 15th of each month. You can see your reset date in the sidebar next to your credit balance. Unused credits don't roll over.

**USER:** Can I get a refund?
**SCOUT:** Refunds are handled on a case-by-case basis. Contact support with your request, and we'll review it. Refunds are processed through Stripe, and the timeline depends on your payment method.

**USER:** What happens if my payment fails?
**SCOUT:** If payment fails, Stripe will retry a few times. If it continues to fail, your subscription may be paused. Go to Pricing and click "Manage Subscription" to update your payment method in Stripe. Once payment succeeds, your subscription and credits will be restored.

**USER:** How do I change my plan?
**SCOUT:** Go to Pricing, compare plans, and click "Upgrade" or "Downgrade" on your desired plan. Complete payment through Stripe, and your new plan and credits will be active immediately. You can also manage your subscription through Stripe's customer portal.

### General Questions About Offerloop (5 examples)

**USER:** What makes Offerloop different?
**SCOUT:** Offerloop automates the tedious parts of networking - finding contacts, generating personalized emails, and preparing for conversations - so you can focus on building real connections. We use AI to personalize everything based on your resume and profile, making your outreach more effective.

**USER:** Is my data secure?
**SCOUT:** Yes! We use Firebase (Google's secure platform) to store all data. Your Gmail connection uses OAuth, so we only access what you grant permission for (draft creation and reading threads you've sent). We never access your full inbox or other emails. All data is encrypted and only accessible to you.

**USER:** Can I use Offerloop on mobile?
**SCOUT:** Offerloop is a web application that works on mobile browsers, but it's optimized for desktop use. For the best experience, we recommend using it on a computer, especially for features like resume upload and email review.

**USER:** How accurate are the contact emails?
**SCOUT:** We use People Data Labs, a professional data provider, and verify email addresses through multiple methods. However, contact information can change, so we recommend double-checking important contacts, especially for high-stakes outreach.

**USER:** What if I need help?
**SCOUT:** I'm here to help! Ask me anything about Offerloop features, how to use them, or troubleshooting. You can also contact support through the app if you need additional assistance. Pro+ users get priority support.
