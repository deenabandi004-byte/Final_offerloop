    Look up a verified email for a ranker candidate. Metered (see
    CREDIT_COSTS["reveal_email"]) on cache-miss + charge-worthy Hunter
    result. Cache-first: subsequent calls within TTL are free. Refund
    on low-confidence / no-hit / error.

    MUST NOT be called on card render — it charges credits. Client
    wires this into the swipe-right handler only. The 30-day cache
    protects against accidental double-charges from client retries.

    Charge rule (both branches → keep the deduction):
      * Hunter returned email_verified == True (SMTP-confirmed), OR
      * email_source == "hunter_finder" AND confidence >= REVEAL_CHARGE_MIN_CONFIDENCE

    Refund rule (any of):
      * verified == False AND confidence < REVEAL_CHARGE_MIN_CONFIDENCE
      * email_source ∈ {"pattern", "domain_generated", "pdl_fallback"}
        (synthesized / best-guess, not deliverability-verified)
      * no email found

    Write to the person the user swiped on. Every other drafting path is
    find-then-draft; here the person is already chosen by hand, so this
    route must never go looking for "someone like them".

    Request body: {"action": "draft"|"send", "deck_id": optional str}

    Pricing: NO additional charge. The reveal-email swipe already paid
    for "the verification and the written email" (see the reveal_person
    note in config.CREDIT_COSTS), so this route requires a fresh reveal
    and generates the email for free. Double-charging the same swipe
    would break that promise.

    Flow:
      1. Idempotency: an existing ranker contact doc for this candidate
         short-circuits to its recorded outcome (client retries on the
         60s timeout must not write the same person twice).
      2. Require a fresh revealedEmails cache entry (the reveal charge).
         No entry, or expired, is a 404: the client reveals first.
      3. Generate with the same batch_generate_emails call prompt-search
         uses, so the voice matches the swipe drafts exactly.
      4. Gmail connected: create the draft there (or send, for
         action=send, behind the same quality gate + daily cap as
         prompt-search send mode). Not connected: the contact doc alone
         is the in-app draft, sent stays false.
      5. Save the contact doc in the runs.py shape so Inbox/Network
         render it like any other outreach.
