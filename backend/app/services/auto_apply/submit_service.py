"""Shared auto-apply submission entrypoint.

Extracted from the /api/job-board/auto-apply/<id>/submit route body so two
callers share ONE implementation of the eligibility / profile / dedupe /
credit checks and the worker hand-off:
  1. the HTTP route (routes/auto_apply.py), and
  2. Scout's auto_apply_to_job chat tool (services/scout/tools.py).

Scout has imported this module since the execute-actions work landed. It did
not exist on this branch, so every "apply me to that job" asked in the app
raised ImportError inside the tool, came back as code INTERNAL, and Scout
told the user something vague had gone wrong. Nothing was ever queued.

Returns (payload dict, http-ish status int). The status doubles as the HTTP
status for the route caller; Scout reads the payload's "code" field.
