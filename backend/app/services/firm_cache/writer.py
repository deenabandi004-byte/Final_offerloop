"""firm_cache.writer — JIT cache write path.

Called from pdl_client.search_contacts_from_prompt right after PDL returns
fresh results. Normalizes each contact through schema.firm_employee_doc_*
and batch-upserts into firm_employees/{linkedin_id}.

Design invariants (in priority order):
  1. NEVER break a search. Every failure path is caught + logged; the
     search's return value is not affected by cache-write outcome.
  2. NEVER add user-visible latency. All Firestore writes go through
     one batched .commit() at the end, not per-doc awaits.

Firestore batch limit is 500 ops per commit. Contact-search results max at
~15 per request (Elite tier), so one batch per call is always enough.
