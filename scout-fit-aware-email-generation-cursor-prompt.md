# Cursor Prompt: Fit-Aware Email Generation

## Context

Offerloop generates personalized networking emails using:
- User's resume (name, school, major, experiences)
- Contact info (name, title, company)
- Detected commonalities (same school, hometown, company)

**The problem:** Emails are generic networking requests. They don't reference the specific job/role the user is targeting or leverage the job fit analysis we now generate.

## Objective

Enhance email generation to use **job fit context** when available:
- The pitch we generated for this role
- Talking points specific to this opportunity
- Strengths and evidence from their resume
- Keywords that matter for this role

**Result:** Emails that feel targeted and intentional, not spray-and-pray networking.

## Files to Modify

### Backend
- `app/services/reply_generation.py` - Core email generation logic
- `app/routes/emails.py` - Email generation endpoint

### Frontend
- Component that calls `/api/emails/generate-and-draft` (needs to pass fit_context)
- State management to persist fit_context from job analysis → email generation

---

## Backend Implementation

### Step 1: Update `batch_generate_emails()` in `reply_generation.py`

Add `fit_context` as an optional parameter:

```python
def batch_generate_emails(
    contacts, 
    resume_text, 
    user_profile, 
    career_interests,
    fit_context=None  # NEW: Job fit analysis context
):
    """
    Generate personalized networking emails.
    
    Args:
        contacts: List of contact dicts
        resume_text: User's resume text
        user_profile: User profile dict
        career_interests: Career interests string
        fit_context: Optional dict with job fit analysis:
            {
                "job_title": "Business Analyst Intern",
                "company": "McKinsey",
                "score": 65,
                "match_level": "moderate",
                "pitch": "As a Data Science major with strong analytical skills...",
                "talking_points": ["specific project", "relevant coursework"],
                "strengths": [{"point": "...", "evidence": "..."}],
                "gaps": [{"gap": "...", "mitigation": "..."}],
                "keywords": ["analytical", "data-driven", "business insights"]
            }
    """
```

### Step 2: Build Fit Context Section for Prompt

Add this after extracting user info (around line 37):

```python
    # Build fit context section if available
    fit_context_section = ""
    if fit_context:
        fit_context_section = f"""
TARGET ROLE CONTEXT:
- Target Role: {fit_context.get('job_title', 'Not specified')}
- Target Company: {fit_context.get('company', 'Not specified')}
- Fit Score: {fit_context.get('score', 'N/A')}%
- Match Level: {fit_context.get('match_level', 'unknown')}

KEY PITCH (use this as inspiration, don't copy verbatim):
{fit_context.get('pitch', '')}

TALKING POINTS TO WEAVE IN:
{chr(10).join(f"- {tp}" for tp in fit_context.get('talking_points', [])[:3])}

STRENGTHS TO HIGHLIGHT:
{chr(10).join(f"- {s.get('point', '')}: {s.get('evidence', '')}" for s in fit_context.get('strengths', [])[:2])}

KEYWORDS TO NATURALLY INCLUDE:
{', '.join(fit_context.get('keywords', [])[:5])}

IMPORTANT: The user is reaching out specifically about {fit_context.get('job_title', 'this role')} opportunities. 
The email should reflect genuine interest in this specific path, not generic networking.
"""
```

### Step 3: Modify the Prompt

Update the main prompt (around line 108) to include fit context:

```python
        # Determine if this is targeted outreach or general networking
        is_targeted_outreach = bool(fit_context and fit_context.get('job_title'))
        
        outreach_type_guidance = ""
        if is_targeted_outreach:
            target_role = fit_context.get('job_title', '')
            target_company = fit_context.get('company', '')
            outreach_type_guidance = f"""
OUTREACH TYPE: Targeted Role Inquiry
The sender is specifically interested in {target_role} roles{f' at {target_company}' if target_company else ''}.
- Reference the specific role/path naturally
- Show you've done research (use the talking points)
- Ask targeted questions about their experience in this type of role
- Position your background as relevant to this specific opportunity
"""
        else:
            outreach_type_guidance = """
OUTREACH TYPE: General Networking
The sender is exploring broadly and building their network.
- Focus on learning about their career journey
- Ask open-ended questions about their experience
- Show genuine curiosity about their work
"""

        prompt = f"""Write {len(contacts)} personalized, natural networking emails. Each email should be unique and tailored to the specific contact.

ABOUT THE SENDER:
- Name: {sender_name}
- University: {sender_university_short if sender_university_short else 'Not specified'}
- Major: {user_info.get('major', 'Not specified')}
- Year: {user_info.get('year', 'Not specified')}{resume_context}
{fit_context_section}
{outreach_type_guidance}

CONTACTS:
{chr(10).join(contact_contexts)}

WRITING GUIDELINES:
1. Be natural and conversational - write like a real person, not a template
2. Each email must be unique - no copy-paste between contacts
3. Personalize based on their role, company, and any connections (alumni, hometown, etc.)
4. {"Reference the target role and weave in talking points naturally" if is_targeted_outreach else "Show genuine curiosity about their career path"}
5. {"Position your relevant experience using the strengths provided" if is_targeted_outreach else "Reference specific details from the sender's resume when relevant"}
6. Keep it concise (80-100 words) but warm and authentic
7. Subject lines should be specific and interesting, not generic
8. {"Ask a specific question related to the target role" if is_targeted_outreach else "Ask about their experience or journey"}

{"SUBJECT LINE GUIDANCE FOR TARGETED OUTREACH:" if is_targeted_outreach else ""}
{"- Include the role or company naturally: 'Quick question about BA roles at McKinsey' or 'Fellow Trojan exploring consulting'" if is_targeted_outreach else ""}
{"- Avoid generic subjects like 'Coffee chat request' or 'Quick question'" if is_targeted_outreach else ""}

FORMATTING:
- Start with "Hi [FirstName],"
- Use \\n\\n for paragraph breaks in JSON
- End with "Best regards,\\n[Sender Full Name]\\n{sender_university_short} | Class of {user_info.get('year', '')}" (only include university/year if available)
- Do NOT mention "attached resume" - that's handled separately

Return ONLY valid JSON:
{{"0": {{"subject": "...", "body": "..."}}, "1": {{"subject": "...", "body": "..."}}, ...}}"""
```

### Step 4: Update the Endpoint in `emails.py`

Modify the `/generate-and-draft` endpoint to accept fit_context:

```python
@emails_bp.post("/generate-and-draft")
@require_firebase_auth
def generate_and_draft():
    """Generate emails and create Gmail drafts"""
    db = get_db()
    uid = request.firebase_user["uid"]
    payload = request.get_json() or {}
    
    contacts = payload.get("contacts", [])
    resume_text = payload.get("resumeText", "")
    user_profile = payload.get("userProfile", {})
    career_interest = payload.get("careerInterests")
    fit_context = payload.get("fitContext")  # NEW
    
    # ... existing Gmail service setup ...
    
    # Generate emails with fit context
    results = batch_generate_emails(
        contacts, 
        resume_text, 
        user_profile, 
        career_interest,
        fit_context=fit_context  # NEW
    )
    
    # ... rest of existing code ...
```

---

## Frontend Implementation

### Step 5: Store Fit Context After Job Analysis

When user analyzes a job and clicks "Find Contacts in This Role", store the fit context:

```typescript
// In your state management (context, zustand, redux, etc.)
interface AppState {
  // ... existing state
  currentFitContext: JobFitContext | null;
}

interface JobFitContext {
  job_title: string;
  company: string;
  score: number;
  match_level: string;
  pitch: string;
  talking_points: string[];
  strengths: Array<{ point: string; evidence: string }>;
  gaps: Array<{ gap: string; mitigation: string }>;
  keywords: string[];
}

// When user clicks "Find Contacts in This Role" after analysis
const handleFindContacts = (job: JobListing, analysis: JobFitAnalysis) => {
  // Store fit context for email generation
  setCurrentFitContext({
    job_title: job.title,
    company: job.company,
    score: analysis.score,
    match_level: analysis.match_level,
    pitch: analysis.pitch,
    talking_points: analysis.talking_points,
    strengths: analysis.strengths,
    gaps: analysis.gaps,
    keywords: analysis.keywords_to_use,
  });
  
  // Fill search form and navigate
  onJobTitleSuggestion(job.title, job.company, job.location);
};
```

### Step 6: Pass Fit Context to Email Generation

When calling the email generation endpoint:

```typescript
const generateEmails = async (selectedContacts: Contact[]) => {
  const response = await fetch(`${BACKEND_URL}/api/emails/generate-and-draft`, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      contacts: selectedContacts,
      resumeText: userResume?.rawText || '',
      userProfile: userProfile,
      careerInterests: careerInterests,
      fitContext: currentFitContext,  // NEW - pass the stored fit context
    }),
  });
  
  // ... handle response
};
```

### Step 7: Clear Fit Context When Appropriate

Clear the fit context when user starts a new search unrelated to a job analysis:

```typescript
// When user manually searches without going through job analysis
const handleManualSearch = () => {
  setCurrentFitContext(null);  // Clear fit context
  // ... proceed with search
};

// When user clicks "Clear" or starts fresh
const handleClearSearch = () => {
  setCurrentFitContext(null);
  // ... reset form
};
```

## Expected Results

### Without Fit Context (General Networking)

```
Subject: Fellow Trojan in consulting - quick question

Hi Sarah,

I'm Deena, a Data Science and Economics major at USC. 
I came across your profile and was impressed by your 
journey to McKinsey. 

I'd love to hear about your experience transitioning 
into consulting. Would you be open to a brief chat?

Best regards,
Deena Bandi
USC | Class of 2025
```

### With Fit Context (Targeted Outreach)

```
Subject: Exploring BA intern roles at McKinsey - fellow Trojan

Hi Sarah,

I'm a Data Science and Economics major at USC specifically 
exploring business analyst opportunities. Your path to 
McKinsey's analytics practice caught my attention.

I've been applying analytical skills to real problems—
recently built a data pipeline for a startup that identified 
$50K in cost savings. I'd love to hear how you positioned 
your quantitative background for consulting, especially 
for intern recruiting.

Would you have 15 minutes for a quick call?

Best regards,
Deena Bandi
USC | Class of 2025

## Key Differences in Generated Email

| Aspect | Without Fit Context | With Fit Context |
|--------|---------------------|------------------|
| Subject | Generic networking | Role-specific |
| Opening | "I came across your profile" | "I'm exploring [role] opportunities" |
| Body | General interest | Specific talking points from analysis |
| Evidence | Generic resume mention | Specific strength + evidence |
| Question | "Tell me about your experience" | "How did you position X for Y?" |
| Intent | Vague exploration | Clear purpose |

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Emails generate correctly WITHOUT fit context (backwards compatible)
- [ ] Emails generate with fit context and include:
  - [ ] Reference to target role in subject
  - [ ] Pitch elements woven naturally into body
  - [ ] At least one talking point included
  - [ ] Specific question related to the role
- [ ] Fit context persists from job analysis → contact search → email generation
- [ ] Fit context clears when user starts unrelated search
- [ ] No errors when fit_context is None or empty
- [ ] Email length stays within bounds (80-100 words)

---

## Edge Cases to Handle

1. **Partial fit context**: User has job_title but analysis failed
   - Use job_title for targeting, skip detailed talking points
   
2. **Contact at different company than target**: 
   - Still use the role context, but ask about their experience in similar roles
   
3. **Alumni connection + fit context**:
   - Lead with alumni connection, then pivot to role interest
   
4. **Multiple contacts, different relevance**:
   - Each email should adapt—PM at target company vs. PM elsewhere

---

## Future Enhancements

1. **Per-contact fit scoring**: If reaching out to 5 people, show which are most relevant to the target role

2. **Email tone variants**: 
   - "More casual" / "More formal" toggle that adjusts based on contact seniority

3. **Follow-up awareness**: 
   - If this is a follow-up email, reference the previous outreach and any new context

4. **A/B subject lines**: 
   - Generate 2 subject options, let user pick or auto-select

5. **Gap-aware framing**:
   - If fit analysis identified gaps, proactively frame them positively in the email
