## ✅ COMPLETED TASKS

### 🔴 CRITICAL PRIORITY

1. **✅ Issue #12: Tier Tampering Prevention**
   - **Fixed:** Created `@require_tier()` decorator that always fetches tier from database
   - **Fixed:** Added security warning to `/user/update-tier` endpoint (admin-only)
   - **Verified:** All routes fetch tier from Firestore, not from client requests
   - **Files Modified:**
     - `backend/app/extensions.py` - Added `require_tier()` decorator
     - `backend/app/routes/billing.py` - Added security warning

### 🟠 HIGH PRIORITY

2. **✅ Issue #3: Batch Size Configuration**
   - **Fixed:** Added explicit `batch_size` field to `TIER_CONFIGS` (1, 5, 15)
   - **Fixed:** Updated `validate_batch_size()` to match audit spec
   - **Clarified:** `max_contacts` (3, 8, 15) = contacts per search, `batch_size` (1, 5, 15) = batch operations
   - **Files Modified:**
     - `backend/app/config.py` - Added batch_size to all tiers
     - `backend/app/routes/firm_search.py` - Updated validation logic

3. **✅ Issue #4: Firestore Security Rules**
   - **Created:** `firestore.rules` file with comprehensive security rules
   - **Features:**
     - Prevents client from modifying tier/subscription fields
     - Blocks Free tier from export operations
     - Validates user ownership of documents
   - **File Created:** `firestore.rules`

4. **✅ Issue #6: Stripe Webhook Handlers**
   - **Fixed:** Added `invoice.paid` handler for monthly resets
   - **Verified:** All webhook handlers exist:
     - `checkout.session.completed` ✅
     - `invoice.paid` ✅ (NEW)
     - `customer.subscription.deleted` ✅
     - `customer.subscription.updated` ✅
   - **Files Modified:**
     - `backend/app/services/stripe_client.py` - Added `handle_invoice_paid()`

5. **✅ Issue #7: Backend Tier Enforcement**
   - **Created:** `@require_tier()` decorator
   - **Applied to:**
     - Firm Search endpoint (`/api/firm-search/search`) ✅
     - CSV Export endpoint (`/api/free-run-csv`) ✅ (renamed, now Pro/Elite only)
   - **Files Modified:**
     - `backend/app/extensions.py` - Created decorator
     - `backend/app/routes/firm_search.py` - Applied decorator
     - `backend/app/routes/runs.py` - Applied decorator to CSV export

6. **✅ Issue #10: Free Tier Reset Logic**
   - **Fixed:** `check_and_reset_usage()` now excludes Free tier (lifetime limits)
   - **Fixed:** Free tier limits never reset (Coffee Chat Prep, Interview Prep, Alumni Searches)
   - **Files Modified:**
     - `backend/app/services/auth.py` - Updated reset logic

## ⚠️ PARTIALLY COMPLETED / NEEDS VERIFICATION

### 🟠 HIGH PRIORITY

7. **⚠️ Issue #11: Elite Features Implementation**
   - **Status:** Need to verify if these features exist:
     - Priority queue for contact generation
     - Personalized outreach templates (tailored to resume) - **FOUND:** Email generation uses resume data
     - Weekly personalized firm insights - **NOT FOUND**
     - Early access to new AI tools - **NOT FOUND**
   - **Action Needed:** 
     - Document missing features as "coming soon" OR
     - Implement priority queue and weekly insights
   - **Note:** Personalized templates appear to exist via resume-based email generation

### 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY

8. **⚠️ Issue #8: Atomic Credit Operations**
   - **Status:** Most operations use atomic methods
   - **Verified:**
     - `deduct_credits_atomic()` uses Firestore transactions ✅
     - `firestore.Increment()` used in runs.py ✅
   - **Action Needed:** Verify all credit deduction paths use atomic operations
   - **Files to Review:**
     - All routes that modify credits

9. **⚠️ Issue #10: Frontend Feature Gates**
   - **Status:** Need systematic review
   - **Action Needed:**
     - Review all components for proper tier checks
     - Verify export buttons are disabled for Free
     - Verify Firm Search is locked for Free
     - Verify smart filters are locked for Free
   - **Components to Check:**
     - `ContactDirectory.tsx`
     - `FirmSearchPage.tsx`
     - `ContactSearchPage.tsx`

10. **⚠️ Issue #5: Usage Tracking Schema**
    - **Status:** Current schema works but could be improved
    - **Current:** Flat fields (`coffeeChatPrepsUsed`, `interviewPrepsUsed`)
    - **Recommended:** Structured objects with reset dates
    - **Action Needed:** Optional improvement for better tracking

### 🟢 LOW PRIORITY

11. **⚠️ Issue #14: UI/UX Consistency**
    - **Status:** Need systematic review
    - **Action Needed:**
      - Verify terminology consistency
      - Check usage displays are accurate
      - Verify reset date displays

## 🧪 TESTING CHECKLIST

### Security Tests
- [ ] Free user cannot access `/api/firm-search/search` (should get 403)

## 📝 NOTES

   ```bash
   firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
   ```

2. **Elite Features:** Some Elite features (weekly insights, early access) may not be implemented yet. Consider:
   - Documenting as "coming soon" in UI
   - Or implementing basic versions

3. **Frontend Review:** Need to systematically review all frontend components for proper tier gating.

4. **Testing:** Comprehensive testing needed before production deployment.

## 🎯 NEXT STEPS

1. **Deploy Firestore Rules** to Firebase
2. **Test all security fixes** (tier enforcement, Firestore rules)
3. **Review frontend components** for proper feature gates
4. **Verify Elite features** or document as coming soon
5. **Run comprehensive integration tests**
