# Coffee Chat Prep Improvements - Summary

This document summarizes all improvements made to the coffee chat prep feature.

## Overview

Multiple enhancements were made to improve the quality, relevance, and reliability of coffee chat preparation PDFs. Changes include prompt refinements, intelligent content selection, hardened data extraction, and internal scoring systems.

---

## 1. Similarity Summary Generation Enhancement

**File:** `backend/app/utils/coffee_chat_prep.py`

**Function:** `generate_coffee_chat_similarity()`

### Changes:
- **Updated prompt** to identify 2-3 strongest similarities instead of generic matches
- **Prioritization** of:
  1. Career trajectory and role transitions
  2. Shared educational institutions
  3. Geographic ties
  4. Similar career transitions
- **Explicit filtering** of weak or generic overlaps
- **Conversational bridge** requirement: prompts now end with natural transition phrases (e.g., "I'm curious about...", "I'd love to learn...")
- **Enhanced context**: Added full experience and education history to prompts
- **Output length**: Maintained 45-60 words with more specific requirements

### Impact:
- More meaningful, specific similarity summaries
- Better connection points for students to reference in conversations
- Reduced generic statements

## 2. Intelligent Question Selection

**Files:** 
- `backend/app/utils/coffee_chat_prep.py`
- `backend/app/services/pdf_builder.py`

### Changes:

#### Added Functions:
- `select_relevant_questions()`: Selects questions based on similarity summary relevance
- `_score_question_relevance()`: Computes 0-1 relevance scores for questions

#### Implementation:
- **Lightweight keyword matching** between questions and similarity summary
- **Filters irrelevant questions** that don't relate to identified similarities
- **Prioritizes top 3 questions** that naturally connect to similarity content
- **Deterministic selection** (no randomness)

### Impact:
- PDFs now show questions that directly relate to identified similarities
- More relevant conversation starters for students
- Better alignment between similarity summary and suggested questions

## 3. Hometown Inference Hardening

**File:** `backend/app/services/coffee_chat.py`

**Function:** `infer_hometown_from_education()`

### Changes:
- **Removed AI research** - eliminated OpenAI calls that could cause hallucinations
- **Explicit extraction only** - hometown extracted only when:
  - City/state explicitly appears in education strings (via regex patterns)
  - OR city/state from PDL location fields AND high school mentioned in education
- **Low confidence handling** - returns empty string if no explicit match found
- **No best guesses** - only returns when there's explicit, pattern-matched location

### Regex Patterns Added:
- "High School, City, State" or "High School - City, State"
- "City High School, State"
- Generic "School/Academy, City, State"

### Impact:
- Eliminated hallucinated hometowns
- Only includes hometown when confidently extracted
- More reliable data quality

## 4. Article & Industry Summary Refinement

**File:** `backend/app/services/coffee_chat.py`

**Functions:** 
- `_summarise_article()`
- `_generate_industry_overview()`

### Changes:
Both prompts updated to:
- **Student-focused context**: "You are preparing a coffee chat brief for a student"
- **Factual and neutral** requirement explicitly stated
- **Natural student voice**: "Briefly mention why this matters...in a way that sounds natural for a student to bring up"
- **Simple, conversational language** requirement
- **Avoid opinionated/marketing language** explicitly forbidden
- **Concrete focus**: Industry summaries focus on concrete trends, not speculation

### Impact:
- Summaries sound more natural and student-appropriate
- More factual, less marketing-oriented
- Better suited for actual conversation use

---

## 5. PDF Copy Polish

**File:** `backend/app/services/pdf_builder.py`

**Function:** `generate_coffee_chat_pdf()`

### Changes:

#### Section Renames:
- "Why You're a Great Match" → **"Why This Conversation Makes Sense"**
- "Conversation Starters" → **"Good Openers"**

#### Usage Note Added:
- Added italicized note at top: *"Use this as context, not a script."*
- Placed after title, before contact information

### Impact:
- More professional, appropriate tone
- Clear guidance on how to use the PDF
- Better sets expectations for students

## 6. Internal Relevance Scoring System

**Files:**
- `backend/app/utils/coffee_chat_prep.py`
- `backend/app/services/coffee_chat.py`
- `backend/app/services/pdf_builder.py`

### Added Functions:

#### Similarity Scoring:
- `_score_similarity_strength()`: Computes 0-1 score for similarity quality
  - Based on: entities, connection words, content length, specific details

#### Question Scoring:
- `_score_question_relevance()`: Computes 0-1 relevance score for questions
  - Based on keyword overlap with similarity summary
  - Normalized scoring with boosting for multiple matches

#### News Scoring:
- `_score_news_relevance()`: Computes 0-1 relevance score for news items
  - Based on tag type (division: 0.9, office: 0.7, industry: 0.5)
  - Adjusted by confidence level (high/medium)

### Updated Selection Logic:

#### Questions:
- `select_relevant_questions()` now uses normalized 0-1 scores
- Selects top 3 questions by relevance score
- Scores computed but not exposed to users

#### News Items:
- PDF builder now scores all news items
- Selects top 3 by relevance score (instead of arbitrary first 3)
- Handles both dict and NewsItem types

### Impact:
- **Data-driven selection** instead of arbitrary ordering
- More relevant content prioritized
- Consistent, deterministic results
- Foundation for future improvements

## Technical Details

### Scoring Methodology

1. **Question Relevance (0-1)**:
   - Keyword extraction from similarity summary
   - Overlap counting between questions and summary
   - Normalized to 0-1 with exponential boosting for multiple matches

2. **News Relevance (0-1)**:
   - Base score by tag type (division highest, industry lowest)
   - Confidence adjustment (+0.1 for high, no change for medium)
   - Capped at 1.0

3. **Similarity Strength (0-1)**:
   - Entity count (max 0.4)
   - Connection words (max 0.2)
   - Content length indicators (0.1-0.3)
   - Specific details bonus (0.1)

### Backward Compatibility

- All changes maintain existing function signatures
- Optional parameters added where needed
- Handles both old dict format and new NewsItem format
- Graceful fallbacks if scoring fails

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Similarity Generation**: Verify output identifies specific connections
2. **Question Selection**: Ensure questions relate to similarity content
3. **Hometown Extraction**: Test with various education formats, verify no hallucinations
4. **News Selection**: Verify division/office news prioritized over generic industry news
5. **Scoring**: Monitor score distributions to ensure reasonable ranges

## Future Enhancements

The scoring system provides a foundation for:
- A/B testing different scoring weights
- Machine learning integration
- User feedback loops
