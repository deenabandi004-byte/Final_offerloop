## 📊 Before vs After

### Before ❌
- White text on light backgrounds (unreadable)
- Hardcoded white/gray colors
- Poor contrast ratios
- User complaint: "white text is hard to see"

### After ✅
- Dark, readable text on light backgrounds
- Theme-aware text colors
- Perfect contrast ratios
- All text clearly visible in both themes

## 🎨 Text Classes Used

### Theme-Aware Utilities
- `.text-hero-primary` - High contrast hero text
- `.text-hero-subtitle` - Subtitle text
- `.text-section-heading` - Section headings (dark in light mode, white in dark mode)
- `.text-section-body` - Body text (dark in light mode, light in dark mode)
- `.text-foreground` - Primary text color (theme-aware)
- `.text-muted-foreground` - Secondary text color (theme-aware)

### How It Works
- **Light Mode**: Text is dark (black/slate) for perfect contrast
- **Dark Mode**: Text is light (white/gray) for perfect contrast
- **Automatic**: Text adapts to theme automatically
