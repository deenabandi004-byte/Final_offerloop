```

---

## Backend Processing Flow

### Step 1: Request Validation & Authorization

**File:** `backend/app/routes/coffee_chat_prep.py:267-367`

**Checks:**
- ✅ LinkedIn URL format validation
- ✅ User authentication (Firebase)
- ✅ Credits availability (≥15 credits)
- ✅ Feature access (tier limits: Free=3, Pro=10, Elite=unlimited)
- ✅ Resume/profile data availability

**Issues:**
- ⚠️ Credits checked but not reserved (race condition possible)
- ⚠️ Hardcoded default credits (120) if user doc doesn't exist
- ⚠️ No validation of LinkedIn URL format before processing

### Step 2: Profile Enrichment (PDL)

**File:** `backend/app/routes/coffee_chat_prep.py:109-124`

**Process:**
- Calls `enrich_linkedin_profile(linkedin_url)` from PDL client
- Extracts: name, company, job title, location, education, experience
- Updates prep status: `enriching_profile`

**Dependencies:**
- People Data Labs API key
- Valid LinkedIn profile URL

**Issues:**
- ❌ No retry logic if PDL API fails
- ❌ No caching of enriched profiles (repeated requests cost credits)
- ❌ Generic error message if enrichment fails

### Step 3: News Research (SERP)

**File:** `backend/app/services/coffee_chat.py:374-494`

**Process:**
1. Builds multiple search queries (company + division, company + office, industry)
2. Executes SERP API searches with time window (default: last 90 days)
3. Filters news items by eligibility (`_is_news_eligible`)
4. Scores relevance (division > office > industry)
5. Generates summaries via OpenAI (30-40 words each)
6. Generates industry overview from top items

**Query Strategy:**
- Priority 1: Company + Division + Office
- Priority 2: Company + Office
- Priority 3: Company + Industry
- Priority 4: Industry only

**Filtering:**
- Rejects: AI, SaaS, fintech, consumer tech, earnings news (unless same company)
- Domain-specific filtering for industrial engineering roles
- Requires explicit company match OR engineering relevance

**Issues:**
- ⚠️ No rate limiting on SERP API calls (could hit limits)
- ⚠️ Multiple queries executed sequentially (slow)
- ⚠️ No caching of news results
- ⚠️ Time window hardcoded to "last 90 days" (configurable but default)

### Step 4: User Context Building

**File:** `backend/app/routes/coffee_chat_prep.py:149-178`

**Process:**
- Parses resume text OR uses stored profile data
- Extracts: name, university, major, graduation year
- Falls back to user profile fields if resume not available

**Data Sources (priority):**
1. `resumeText` → `parse_resume_info()`
2. `resumeParsed` from user profile
3. `firstName`, `lastName`, `university`, `fieldOfStudy`, `graduationYear`

**Issues:**
- ⚠️ Resume parsing may fail silently
- ⚠️ No validation that extracted data is meaningful

### Step 5: Hometown Inference

**File:** `backend/app/services/coffee_chat.py:497-573`

**Process:**
- **NO AI** - Only explicit pattern matching
- Regex patterns for education strings:
  - "High School, City, State"
  - "City High School, State"
  - Generic "School/Academy, City, State"
- OR: PDL location fields + high school mention

**Quality:**
- ✅ Conservative approach (no hallucinations)
- ✅ Returns empty string if no match (not None)
- ✅ Only extracts when confidence is high

**Issues:**
- ⚠️ Limited pattern coverage (may miss variations)
- ⚠️ No validation of extracted city/state

### Step 6: Similarity Summary Generation

**File:** `backend/app/utils/coffee_chat_prep.py:61-250`

**Process:**
1. OpenAI GPT-4o-mini call with detailed prompt
2. Post-processing filters:
   - Rejects if result is "NONE" or <20 chars
   - Filters generic phrases
   - Checks for specific details (proper nouns)
   - Removes trailing question marks
   - Filters geographic similarity if not allowed

**Prompt Strategy:**
- Focus on 2-3 strongest, explicit connections
- Prioritizes: university, career transitions, geographic (if both locations explicit)
- Requires declarative ending (not question)

**Quality Controls:**
- ✅ Multiple post-processing filters
- ✅ Returns empty string if quality insufficient
- ✅ Geographic similarity only if both locations explicit

**Issues:**
- ⚠️ Single OpenAI call (no retry on failure)
- ⚠️ No caching of similarity summaries
- ⚠️ Temperature 0.5 may still produce variations

### Step 7: Question Generation

**File:** `backend/app/utils/coffee_chat_prep.py:253-418`

**Process:**
1. OpenAI GPT-4o-mini generates up to 8 candidate questions
2. Strict filtering:
   - Rejects generic patterns ("what inspired you", "typical day")
   - Requires explicit role/company/career references
  3. Relevance scoring against similarity summary
  4. Selects top 3 by relevance score

**Filtering Rules:**
- Must reference: job title, company, OR career decisions
- Rejects: generic inspiration questions, typical day questions
- Requires at least 2 quality questions (returns [] if <2)

**Issues:**
- ⚠️ JSON parsing may fail if OpenAI returns malformed JSON
- ⚠️ No retry logic
- ⚠️ Minimum 2 questions requirement may be too strict

### Step 8: PDF Generation

**File:** `backend/app/services/pdf_builder.py:24-190`

**Process:**
1. Creates PDF using ReportLab
2. Sections (conditional rendering):
   - Title + usage note
   - Contact info (name, role, company, office, hometown)
   - Similarity summary (if non-empty)
   - Questions (if ≥2 quality questions)
   - Recent headlines (top 3 by relevance score)
   - Industry summary (if available)

**Content Selection:**
- News items: Top 3 by relevance score (0-1 scale)
- Questions: Top 3 by relevance to similarity summary
- All sections conditionally rendered (empty = omitted)

**Issues:**
- ⚠️ No error recovery if PDF generation fails
- ⚠️ Fallback PDF is minimal (just error message)
- ⚠️ No validation of PDF file size

### Step 9: Storage & Completion

**File:** `backend/app/routes/coffee_chat_prep.py:209-253`

**Process:**
1. Upload PDF to Firebase Storage
2. Make blob public (or generate signed URL)
3. Update prep record with all generated content
4. Deduct credits atomically
5. Increment usage counter

**Storage Path:**
- `coffee_chat_preps/{userId}/{prepId}.pdf`

**Issues:**
- ⚠️ Credits deducted AFTER completion (user could exhaust credits during processing)
- ⚠️ No rollback if credit deduction fails
- ⚠️ Usage counter increment not atomic with credit deduction
- ⚠️ PDF made public (privacy concern?)

---

## Performance Considerations

### Processing Time

**Current:** ~30-60 seconds per prep

**Breakdown:**
- PDL enrichment: ~2-5 seconds
- SERP queries (4 queries): ~8-12 seconds
- OpenAI calls (up to 8): ~10-20 seconds
- PDF generation: ~1-2 seconds
- Storage upload: ~1-2 seconds

**Bottlenecks:**
1. Sequential SERP queries (could be parallelized)
2. Sequential OpenAI calls (could be parallelized)
3. No caching of repeated data

### API Costs

**Per Prep:**
- PDL: 1 API call
- SERP: 4 API calls (up to 4 queries)
- OpenAI: Up to 8 API calls
- Firebase: 1 write (prep record) + 1 storage upload

**Optimization Opportunities:**
- Cache PDL results (same LinkedIn URL)
- Cache SERP results (same company/division)
- Cache OpenAI summaries (same news articles)
- Parallelize API calls

### Database Queries

**Per Prep:**
- 1 read (user doc)
- 1 write (prep creation)
- Multiple updates (status changes)
- 1 final update (completion)
- 1 read (credit deduction)
- 1 update (credit deduction)
- 1 update (usage counter)

**Optimization:**
- Batch status updates
- Use transactions for credit deduction + usage counter

---

## Error Handling

### Current Error Handling

**Backend:**
- Try-catch blocks around major operations
- Status updates on failure (`status: "failed"`)
- Error messages stored in prep record

**Frontend:**
- Error toasts on failures
- Status polling shows failed state
- No retry mechanism

### Missing Error Handling

1. **No Retry Logic**
   - Transient API failures cause permanent failures
   - **Fix:** Implement exponential backoff retries

2. **No Partial Recovery**
   - If step 5 fails, steps 1-4 are lost
   - **Fix:** Save intermediate results

3. **No User Notification**
   - User must poll to see failures
   - **Fix:** WebSocket or push notifications

4. **No Error Logging**
   - Errors only printed to console
   - **Fix:** Structured logging (Sentry, etc.)
