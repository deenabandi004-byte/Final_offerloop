# Dashboard Backend Implementation Tasks

## Overview
This document outlines all backend tasks needed to support the home page (Dashboard) frontend features. Currently, many features are calculated client-side or use mock data. We need to create efficient backend endpoints to support these features.

## 🔨 Tasks to Implement

### 1. Dashboard Statistics API
**Priority: High**

**Endpoint:** `GET /api/dashboard/stats`

**Purpose:** Provide aggregated statistics for the dashboard KPI cards

**Response:**
```json
{
  "contactsFound": 156,
  "firmsSearched": 42,
  "coffeeChatsCreated": 12,
  "repliesReceived": 68,
  "responseRate": 0.68,
  "totalTimeSavedHours": 24.5,
  "interviewPrepsCreated": 8,
  "interviewPrepsThisMonth": 3
}
```

**Implementation Notes:**
- Calculate `contactsFound` from user's contacts collection
- Calculate `firmsSearched` from firm search history
- Calculate `coffeeChatsCreated` from coffee chat preps
- Calculate `repliesReceived` from contacts with `hasUnreadReply=true` or `threadStatus='new_reply'`
- Calculate `responseRate` as replies / contacts with emails sent
- Calculate `totalTimeSavedHours` using formula: (contacts * 20min + firms * 2min + coffeeChats * 30min) / 60
- Calculate `interviewPrepsCreated` from interview prep history
- Filter `interviewPrepsThisMonth` by current month

**Files to Create/Modify:**
- `backend/app/routes/dashboard.py` (new file)
- `backend/app/routes/__init__.py` (register blueprint)

### 2. Weekly Summary API
**Priority: High**

**Endpoint:** `GET /api/dashboard/weekly-summary`

**Purpose:** Provide weekly activity summary (last 7 days)

**Response:**
```json
{
  "contactsGenerated": 12,
  "firmsSearched": 5,
  "coffeeChatsCreated": 3,
  "interviewPrepsCreated": 2,
  "totalActivities": 22
}
```

**Implementation Notes:**
- Query activities collection filtered by timestamp (last 7 days)
- Count activities by type: `contactSearch`, `firmSearch`, `coffeePrep`, `interviewPrep`
- Return aggregated counts

**Files to Create/Modify:**
- `backend/app/routes/dashboard.py`

---

### 3. Streak API
**Priority: Medium**

**Endpoint:** `GET /api/dashboard/streak`

**Purpose:** Calculate and return user's login streak

**Response:**
```json
{
  "currentStreak": 7,
  "longestStreak": 14,
  "lastActivityDate": "2025-12-04"
}
```

**Implementation Notes:**
- Query activities collection, group by day (any activity on a day = logged in)
- Calculate consecutive days from today backwards
- Track longest streak across all time
- Cache result in user document for performance
- Update cache when new activity is logged

**Files to Create/Modify:**
- `backend/app/routes/dashboard.py`
- `backend/app/services/dashboard_service.py` (new - streak calculation logic)

---

### 4. Goals Progress API
**Priority: Medium**

**Endpoint:** `GET /api/dashboard/goals/progress`

**Purpose:** Calculate progress for all user goals

**Response:**
```json
{
  "goals": [
    {
      "id": "goal123",
      "type": "contacts",
      "target": 50,
      "current": 35,
      "percentage": 70,
      "period": "month"
    },
    {
      "id": "goal456",
      "type": "firms",
      "target": 20,
      "current": 12,
      "percentage": 60,
      "period": "month"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Implementation Notes:**
- Fetch all goals from user's goals collection
- For each goal, calculate current progress based on:
  - `contacts`: Count contacts created within goal period
  - `firms`: Count firm search activities within goal period
  - `coffeeChats`: Count coffee chat prep activities within goal period
  - `outreach`: Count contacts with `firstContactDate` within goal period and status != 'Not Contacted'
- Calculate percentage: `(current / target) * 100`

**Files to Create/Modify:**
- `backend/app/routes/dashboard.py`
- `backend/app/services/dashboard_service.py` (goal progress calculation)

---

### 5. Activity Feed API
**Priority: Low** (Already works client-side, but could optimize)

**Endpoint:** `GET /api/dashboard/activities?limit=10`

**Purpose:** Get recent activities for the activity feed

**Response:**
```json
{
  "activities": [
    {
      "id": "act123",
      "type": "firmSearch",
      "summary": "Searched for investment banking firms in New York",
      "timestamp": "2025-12-04T10:30:00Z",
      "metadata": {}
    }
  ]
}
```

**Implementation Notes:**
- Query activities collection, ordered by timestamp desc
- Limit results (default 10)
- Return formatted for frontend consumption

**Files to Create/Modify:**
- `backend/app/routes/dashboard.py`

**Note:** This is optional since it already works client-side via Firestore. Consider if we want to move it to backend for consistency.

    {
      "month": "Jan",
      "outreach": 12,
      "replies": 8
    },
    {
      "month": "Feb",
      "outreach": 19,

      "metadata": {
        "firmIds": ["firm1", "firm2"]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Implementation Notes:**

---

## Database Considerations

### New Fields Needed:
- **Contacts Collection:**
  - `scheduledDate` (string, ISO date) - For calendar events
  - `scheduledTime` (string, time) - For calendar events
  - `eventType` (string) - 'video', 'phone', 'in-person'
  - `eventStatus` (string) - 'confirmed', 'pending', 'cancelled'

### Indexes Needed:
- Activities collection: `timestamp` (descending) - for activity feed and streak
- Contacts collection: `firstContactDate` - for outreach chart
- Contacts collection: `company` - for top firms aggregation

---

## Testing Checklist

For each endpoint:
- [ ] Test with authenticated user
- [ ] Test with user with no data (empty state)
- [ ] Test with user with large dataset (performance)
- [ ] Test error handling (database errors, auth errors)
- [ ] Verify response format matches frontend expectations
- [ ] Test edge cases (null values, missing fields)

---

## Notes

- Most calculations can be done efficiently with Firestore queries
- Consider caching expensive calculations (streak, goals progress) in user document
- Some features (like AI recommendations) may require OpenAI API calls
- Calendar functionality may require a separate `calendar_events` collection if we want more robust scheduling
- US Map coordinates can be hardcoded for major cities or use a geocoding service
