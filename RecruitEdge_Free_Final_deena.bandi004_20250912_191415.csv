I hope this message finds you well. My name is Nicholas Wittig, and I am a Business Administration student at the University of Southern California, graduating in 2027. I came across your profile while researching professionals in the legal field and noticed your impressive work as a law clerk at the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office.

As I explore potential career paths in finance, I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to learn from your experiences and insights. I am particularly interested in how legal frameworks intersect with financial practices, and I believe your perspective would be invaluable.

Would you be open to a brief 15-20 minute chat in the next week or two? I would love to hear your thoughts and any advice you might have for someone starting out in the finance sector.

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to the possibility of connecting.

Best regards,
Nicholas Wittig
