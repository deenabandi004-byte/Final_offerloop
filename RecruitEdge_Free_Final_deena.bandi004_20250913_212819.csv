I hope this message finds you well. My name is Nicholas Wittig, and I am a Business Administration major at the University of Southern California, graduating in 2027. I am reaching out because I am very interested in pursuing a career in finance, particularly in investment banking, and I noticed your impressive work at Perella Weinberg Partners.

As someone who shares a background from USC, I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to learn from your experiences in the field. If you have 15-20 minutes to spare in the next couple of weeks, I would love to chat and gain insights on your journey and any advice you might have for someone just starting out.

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to the possibility of connecting!

Best regards,
Nicholas Wittig
