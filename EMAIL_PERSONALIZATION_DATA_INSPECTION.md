**Note:** `key_experiences` and `achievements` are NOT currently extracted from the resume parser output. They would need to be computed from the `experience[]` and `awards[]` arrays.

---

## 3. DATA FLOW INTO EMAIL GENERATION

### 3.1 Entry Point

**Function:** `backend/app/services/reply_generation.py::batch_generate_emails()`

**Parameters:**
- `contacts`: List of contact dicts (PDL-enriched)
- `resume_text`: Raw resume text string
- `user_profile`: User profile dict from Firestore
- `career_interests`: Career interests string
- `fit_context`: Optional job fit analysis dict

### 3.2 User Info Extraction

**Function:** `extract_user_info_from_resume_priority(resume_text, user_profile)`

**Priority:**
1. **Resume parsing** (if `resume_text` available) → `parse_resume_info()`
2. **Profile fallback** (if resume missing fields)

**Output:** `user_info` dict containing:
- `name`, `university`, `major`, `year` (basic info)
- `education` (full education dict)
- `experience[]` (full experience array)
- `projects[]` (full projects array)
- `skills` (dict or list)

### 3.3 Contact Context Construction

**Location:** `batch_generate_emails()` lines 85-136

**Process:**
1. For each contact, call `detect_commonality(user_info, contact, resume_text)`
2. Extract: `FirstName`, `LastName`, `Company`, `Title`
3. Compute: `industry = determine_industry(company, title)`
4. Build `contact_context` string:
   ```
   Contact {i}: {firstname} {lastname}
   - Role: {title} at {company}
   - Industry: {industry}
   - Connection: {personalization_note}
   - Personalize by: Mentioning their role/company...
   ```

**Currently Used Contact Fields:**
- ✅ `FirstName`, `LastName`
- ✅ `Company`, `Title`
- ✅ `College`, `EducationTop` (via `detect_commonality()`)
- ✅ `City` (via `detect_commonality()` for hometown)

**Currently UNUSED Contact Fields:**
- ❌ `WorkSummary` (full employment history)
- ❌ `VolunteerHistory`
- ❌ `Phone`, `PersonalEmail`, `WorkEmail`
- ❌ `SocialProfiles`
- ❌ `Group`
- ❌ `LinkedInConnections`
- ❌ PDL `experience[]` array (full employment history)
- ❌ PDL `education[]` array (full education history)
- ❌ PDL `interests[]`
- ❌ PDL `summary`
- ❌ Company size, industry tags, job title role/sub_role

### 3.4 Resume Context Construction

**Location:** `batch_generate_emails()` lines 138-157

**Currently Included:**
- `key_experiences` (top 2) - **BUT THIS FIELD IS NOT EXTRACTED FROM RESUME PARSER**
- `skills` (top 3) - Flattened from dict structure
- `achievements` (top 1) - **BUT THIS FIELD IS NOT EXTRACTED FROM RESUME PARSER**

**Note:** `key_experiences` and `achievements` are referenced but not actually populated from the resume parser output. They would need to be computed from `experience[]` and `awards[]`.

### 3.5 Commonality Detection

**Function:** `backend/app/utils/coffee_chat_prep.py::detect_commonality()`

**Checks:**
1. **University** (strongest): Compares `user_info.university` with `contact.College` + `contact.EducationTop`
2. **Hometown**: Compares `extract_hometown_from_resume(resume_text)` with `contact.City`
3. **Company**: Compares `extract_companies_from_resume(resume_text)` with `contact.Company`

**Returns:**
- `commonality_type`: "university" | "hometown" | "company" | "general"
- `commonality_details`: Dict with specific details (e.g., `{'university': 'USC'}`)

### 3.6 Final Prompt Construction

**Location:** `batch_generate_emails()` lines 228-335

**Sections:**
1. **ABOUT THE SENDER:**
   - Name, University (shorthand), Major, Year
   - `resume_context` (key experiences, skills, achievements) - **BUT THESE ARE NOT POPULATED**

2. **TARGET ROLE CONTEXT** (if `fit_context` provided):
   - Job title, company, fit score, match level
   - Pitch, talking points, strengths, keywords

3. **CONTACTS:**
   - `contact_contexts` (one per contact)

## 4. ANCHOR CANDIDATES

### 4.1 Strong Anchor Candidates (High Reliability + High Value)

| Field | Source | Why It's Safe | Example Usage |
|-------|--------|---------------|---------------|
| `contact.Company` | PDL | Always present, exact match | "I noticed you work at Google..." |
| `contact.Title` | PDL | Always present, specific | "As a Senior Software Engineer..." |
| `contact.FirstName` | PDL | Always present | "Hi John," |
| `contact.College` | PDL | High reliability, strong connection | "Fellow USC alum..." |
| `user_info.education.university` | Resume | High reliability | "As a USC student..." |
| `user_info.experience[].company` | Resume | High reliability, exact match | "I also interned at Google..." |
| `user_info.experience[].title` | Resume | High reliability | "As a Software Engineering Intern..." |

### 4.2 Medium Anchor Candidates (Medium Reliability)

| Field | Source | Why It's Medium | Example Usage |
|-------|--------|-----------------|---------------|
| `contact.City` | PDL | Often present but may be missing | "Based in San Francisco..." |
| `contact.State` | PDL | Often present but may be missing | "California-based..." |
| `user_info.experience[].bullets[]` | Resume | High reliability but long | "Your experience with [specific project]..." |
| `user_info.skills.programming_languages[]` | Resume | High reliability | "Given your Python experience..." |
| `contact.WorkSummary` | PDL (constructed) | Medium reliability, constructed | "Your background at Google and Microsoft..." |

### 4.3 Weak Anchor Candidates (Low Reliability or Risky)

| Field | Source | Why It's Weak | Risk |
|-------|--------|--------------|------|
| `contact.Phone` | PDL | Often missing | Low risk, just missing |
| `contact.PersonalEmail` | PDL | Often missing | Low risk, just missing |
| `contact.VolunteerHistory` | PDL | Often missing | Low risk, just missing |
| `contact.LinkedInConnections` | PDL | Often missing, not meaningful | Low value |
| `user_info.achievements[]` | Resume | Not currently extracted | Would need extraction |
| `user_info.extracurriculars[]` | Resume | Often missing | Low risk, just missing |

---

## 5. DEBUG UTILITY

### 5.1 How to Use

**File:** `backend/app/services/reply_generation.py`

**Enable Debug:**
```python
DEBUG_EMAIL_DATA_INSPECTION = True  # Set to True
```

**What It Does:**
- Prints full contact object (first contact only)
- Prints full sender/user object
- Prints exact `contact_context` text sent to LLM
- Prints commonality detection results
- Prints fit context (if available)

**Output Location:** Console logs when `batch_generate_emails()` is called

**Security:** Automatically redacts emails and phone numbers

### 5.2 Removing Debug Code

After inspection, remove:
1. The `DEBUG_EMAIL_DATA_INSPECTION` flag
2. The `_debug_print_email_data()` function
3. The debug call in the contact loop

---

## 6. FINDINGS & RECOMMENDATIONS

### 6.1 Key Findings

1. **Rich Data Available but Underutilized:**
   - Full PDL `experience[]` array available but only current job used
   - Full resume `experience[]` array available but only top 2 used (and not properly extracted)
   - PDL `education[]` array available but only primary school used
   - Skills structured by category but only top 3 used

2. **Missing Computations:**
   - `key_experiences` referenced but not extracted from resume parser
   - `achievements` referenced but not extracted from resume parser
   - These fields would need to be computed from `experience[]` and `awards[]`

3. **Unused High-Value Fields:**
   - `contact.WorkSummary` - Full employment history
   - `contact.VolunteerHistory` - Volunteer work
   - `user_info.experience[].bullets[]` - Detailed experience bullets
   - `user_info.projects[]` - Full project descriptions
   - PDL `experience[]` array - Full employment history with dates

4. **Anchor Opportunities:**
   - Company names (both contact and sender) - **STRONG**
   - Job titles (both contact and sender) - **STRONG**
   - Universities (both contact and sender) - **STRONG**
   - Specific experience bullets (sender) - **MEDIUM**
   - Skills overlap (both contact and sender) - **MEDIUM**

### 6.2 Recommendations for Anchor Implementation

1. **Start with Strong Anchors:**
   - Company names (exact match)
   - Job titles (exact or similar)
   - Universities (exact match)

2. **Add Medium Anchors:**
   - Shared skills (if both have Python, mention it)
   - Experience overlap (if sender worked at contact's company)
   - Location (if both in same city)

3. **Avoid Weak Anchors:**
   - Phone numbers, personal emails (often missing)
   - Volunteer history (often missing)
   - LinkedIn connections (not meaningful)

4. **Extract Missing Fields:**
   - Compute `key_experiences` from `experience[]` array
   - Compute `achievements` from `awards[]` array
   - Use full `experience[].bullets[]` for detailed personalization
